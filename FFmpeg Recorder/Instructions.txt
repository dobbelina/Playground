Done!
Now copy the created playercorefactory.xml & playercorefactory2.xml to this folder:

A shortcut has been created on the desktop to toggle between
the 2 playercorefactory files, making FFMPEG Recorder default player or not.
Press "Q" to stop an ongoing recording/download.

Default container format is mp4, but you can change it by editing the Options 
section in ffmpeg.ini to any of the formats supported by ffmpeg, and there are plenty.
In the Options section you can also edit the timestamp switch to off, 
if you don't like it in the view window.
Recorded video don't have a timestamp.

On "plugin.video.f4mTester" stream links, the watch option doesn't work, only download.
Convert such links to "standard" m3u format by extracting the url link, if you want to 
download and watch at the same time.

Have fun with it!
