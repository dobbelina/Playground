# Auto-Resume Livestreams In Kodi

So what does it do?

It checks the colour on 2 different coordinates every 2 seconds on the screen.

As soon as a video or stream cuts of or ends it hits p, (Play) resuming whatever you are watching,

as the colour of your 2 skin coordinates will match.

When executed the first time the user can input what command to send to kodi,(p = play)

and an appropriate shortcut key to toggle the function on and off.

After that you get prompted to click twice on 2 different coordinates in the

skin, when the player is idle.

Preferably in an area that is consistent among the different addons.

When setup is finished you hear 2 short beeps.

All settings get saved in the file 2-Coordinates.ini that gets created in the same folder as the exe.

To re-run the setup, simply delete the ini file.
